**tRFtarget** (http://trftarget.net/) integrates **computational predicted** and **experimental validated** binding interactions between transfer RNA-derived fragments (tRFs) and target transcripts for multiple organisms.

Users can:

* Search or browse predicted tRF targets
* Run our pipeline [tRFtarget-pipeline](https://github.com/ZWang-Lab/tRFtarget-pipeline) to get targets of tRFs or other small non-coding RNAs (such as miRNAs) locally or via our web service in [http://trftarget.net/online_targets](http://trftarget.net/online_targets)
* Browse experimental evidences of the predicted tRF-RNA interactions based on manually curated publications
