# tRFtarget
**tRFtarget** (http://trftarget.net/) is a relational database to explore binding targets of transfer RNA-derived fragments (tRFs).

For running our pipeline to get targets of tRFs not indexed in our database or other small non-coding RNAs (such as miRNAs), please submit a request via web service in [http://trftarget.net/online_targets](http://trftarget.net/online_targets) or refer our GitHub repository [tRFtarget-pipeline](https://github.com/ZWang-Lab/tRFtarget-pipeline).
