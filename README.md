# tRFtarget
**tRFtarget** (http://trftarget.net/) is a relational database to explore binding targets of transfer RNA-derived fragments (tRFs).

For running our pipeline to get targets of tRFs not indexed in our database or other small non-coding RNAs (such as miRNAs), please refer our GitHub repository [tRFtarget-pipeline](https://github.com/ZWang-Lab/tRFtarget-pipeline)

## About tRF
**Transfer RNA-derived fragments** (**tRFs**) are a new class of small noncoding RNA (ncRNA) in the length of 13-48 nucleotides. tRFs are derived from non-random cleavage of either the precursor or mature tRNA.

## About tRFtarget
**tRFtarget** is a relational database respect to the computational predicted binding interactions between tRFs and target transcripts for multiple organisms based on the state-of-the-art prediction tools [RNAhybrid](https://bibiserv.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/rnahybrid) and [IntaRNA](http://rna.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/IntaRNA/Input.jsp).

The database can provide detailed information about the binding interactions as well as an illustration of the interaction sequences. Furthermore, the database can be also searched by *tRF ID*, *gene* or *transcript* to get a comprehensive transcriptome-wide overview of tRF-target interactions.

The database also provides experimental evidence of the predicted tRF-mRNA interactions and functional studies on tRFs based on manually curated publications. The experimental evidence are classed into 2 categories: *gene level evidence* and *site level evidence*.
